Instructions:
=============

## Getting a Client ID
### Enable Developer Mode

#### On Desktop:
1. Open Discord and go to your User Settings by clicking on the gear icon at the bottom left corner.
2. Navigate to the "Advanced" section.
3. Find the "Developer Mode" toggle and enable it by clicking the switch.

#### On Mobile:
1. Open Discord and tap on the menu icon (three horizontal lines) at the top left corner.
2. Scroll down and tap on "User Settings."
3. Scroll down to the "Advanced" section.
4. Tap on "Developer Mode" and enable it by toggling the switch.

### Copying the Client ID
#### On Desktop:
1. Open the server or direct message where the bot is located.
2. Right-click on the bot's name or profile picture.
3. Select "Copy User ID" from the context menu.

#### On Mobile:
1. Open the server or direct message where the bot is located.
2. Tap on the bot's name or profile picture.
3. Tap on the three-dot menu icon that appears.
4. Select "Copy User ID" from the menu.

### Using the Copied ID
Once you have copied the user ID, you can paste it in the "Client ID" box on the site.

After you have your Client ID in the website, you should now set up the best permissions for your bot's use case, as just 8 (Administrator) is a big security risk and is not trusted by most people.

## Getting The Perfect Permissions
To select the permissions you want to use for your bot, I recommend using [this amazing website by `abalabahaha`](https://discordapi.com/permissions.html).
After getting the permissions you want to use, go back to the generator and put it into the `Permissions` input.

###  Sharing The Link With Permissions
Modifying the `Permissions` input will change the page url to have `#(permissionID)`, so if you reload that same url, the permission will already be in the `Permissions` input.
I did this for my project, [Ben](https://github.com/Ben-Network/Ben-Bot?tab=readme-ov-file#invite-the-bot), to simplify the process of generating an invite link for the bot.
